alright. now write the documentation for the Lua API for the following functions by following the same style and structure.
remember to start the functions with `imgui.` in the examples.

however this is a bit different because the functions are for a class (metatable) called ImDrawListMT. You should begin the function name with "ImDrawListMT:"
