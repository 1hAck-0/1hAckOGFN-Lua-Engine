# Online Script Explorer

## Introduction

When the Online Script Explorer is launched, it will make the Lua Engine really useful for every 1hAck user. You'll be able to find and add new features easily, thanks to scripts made by us and by other users. This means you won't have to wait for us, the official developers, to add new things.

## Uploading Scripts

Everyone can upload their own scripts for everyone to use. But we know that some people might try to upload harmful scripts or try to overload our servers. So, we're going to carefully check each script to make sure it's safe and useful. Trying to do anything malicious with this feature will likely lead to your license being permanently suspended.

## Rewards for Contribution

We plan to give out rewards to people who create good scripts. Not every script will get a reward, especially if it's very basic. But if you make something great, we'll make sure to recognize your effort.

### How You Get Rewarded

What will the reward be? It could be a free license key or even real money. The size of the reward will depend on how popular and useful your script is. If your script is picked for a reward, we'll contact you on Discord. You can also ask for a certain reward when you upload your script, and we'll consider it.

The biggest reward you can get? It could be multiple lifetime keys or up to **100 EURO**, paid in PayPal or cryptocurrency. But those big rewards are only for really amazing work that adds a lot to what our menu can do.

## Content Verification and Information

We'll make sure to check all scripts before anyone can download them. We'll mark safe scripts so you know they are okay to use. If we get too many scripts to check, we might let some go public without a safety check, but we'll make sure to mark those as unverified.

### More Info on Scripts

Here's the kind of information you can expect to see for each script:

- **Title**: A short name for the script.

- **Description**: A quick summary from the person who made the script.

- **Download Counter**: A number showing how many users downloaded the script.

- **How to Use**: Simple steps for using the script, if needed.

- **Awards**: Any rewards the script has earned, to inspire you to make your own.

- **Dependencies**: A list of other script or library files you'll need for the script to work properly.

- **Compatibility**: Any known platform issues with the script, so you can make sure it will work for you.

#### Ratings

- **Easy to Use**: A score from 1-10 showing how easy the script is to use.

- **Usefulness**: A score from 1-10 showing how helpful the script is.

- **Skill Level**: A score from 1-10 showing how hard the script is to make. This can help if you want to learn from other scripts.

- **Source Code**: Since Lua scripts are not hidden code, you'll be able to see the source code when you download the script. This can help you understand how it works.

We hope all this information makes it easy and safe for you to find and use scripts from the Online Script Explorer.
