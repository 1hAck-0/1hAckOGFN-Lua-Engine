## For Regular Users

### Introduction

The Script Browser is an innovative addition to the 1hAck user experience, providing you with access to a wide range of new features thorugh scripts made by us and you, the community. This new feature ensures that you don't have to wait for official updates to get new features.

### Terms of Service

By using the Script Browser, you agree to the following terms:

1. Use unverified scripts at your own risk! We ensure script safety by manually reviewing every uploaded script however reviews can take a bit to complete.
2. Do NOT misuse the service to upload malicious content or attempt any kind of unauthorized access. Doing so may result in a license suspension.
3. Do not copy or claim others' scripts as your own.

### Safety and Verification

We prioritize your safety by:
- Carefully reviewing each script for security and utility.
- Marking verified safe scripts and indicating unverified ones for your awareness.

### Usage

To get started as a regular 1hAck user, simply go to the "Scripts" tab in the main menu and click on the large "Script Browser" button to open the script browser. From there things should be self-explanatory. We've also included many tooltips explaining some unfamiliar things/elements in the GUI so attempt to hover an item that you may not fully understand and read the tooltip if available.

## For Developers

### Introduction

All users are invited to enrich the 1hAck community by uploading their own script(s), making the Lua Engine even more powerful for all users while **learning and earning**! Learn about [monetizing your script](#monetization) but first:

### Terms of Service for Developers

1. Uploading any malicious script in any way or form is completely forbidden.
2. Only upload your script once. To make changes, use the Workspace to edit it. Don't reupload any script.
3. Do not take or upload someone else's script.
4. Do not upload any script that is completely useless, for example a "Hello World" script.
5. When you upload a script, you let us distribute and manually review it.

### Monetization

#### Requirements

1. **Verification for Monetization**: Your script must be reviewed and approved by an official developer before it can start earning money.

2. **Utility Rating**: We generally allow monetization for scripts that are rated above 5/10 on utility by our reviewing team, but there might be exceptions.

3. **Compliance with Terms**: If you try to make money by violating our [Terms of Service](#terms-of-service-for-developers), there will be penalties.

#### Details

1. **Earnings per Install**: You'll receive **$0.50 for every unique installation** of your script.

2. **One Install Per User**: Installs by the same user more than once are counted as one.

3. **Early Advantage**: The current payout rate is high as you hopefully realized, but as this feature grows and more and more developers need to be paid, the rate may decrease, so **starting early** is crutial if you want to take advantage of monetization.

#### Getting Paid

7. **Payment Method**: While we're developing an invoice system for direct balance withdrawals, you currently need to contact support to withdraw from your developer balance. We will let you choose between **PayPal** or **Crypto** (BTC, LTC, ETH).

8. **Minimum Balance**: The minimum withdraw amount is $5, withdrawing less is not possible.

9. **Currency**: All earnings are labeled and calculated in **USD**.
