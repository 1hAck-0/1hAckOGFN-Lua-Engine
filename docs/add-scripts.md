# Using & Adding Scripts

## Adding a Script File

Incorporating a new script into the 1hAck menu is a straightforward process. Follow these steps:

1. Load [1hAck OG Fortnite](https://1hack.org/shop).

2. Navigate to the "Scripts" tab within the GUI menu.

3. Scroll down to locate the "Script Explorer".

4. Note the folder path displayed, indicating the default Scripts folder. The path will differ for each user but should resemble `C:\1938572352395\Fortnite\Scripts`.

5. Download the script file(s) you want to use and locate them in your file explorer.

6. Select the desired script file, right-click, and choose either "Copy" or "Cut."

7. Navigate to the Scripts folder identified in Step 4.

8. Paste the copied or cut script file into this folder by right-clicking and selecting "Paste."

9. With the script file in place, you may close your file explorer.

10. Return to the "Script Explorer" within the GUI menu. Click the label next to the arrow to expand the "Scripts" folder.

11. Locate your newly added script file, then click the "..." button beside it.

12. Choose "Add" from the options presented.

13. Congratulations, your script has been added! Repeat these steps for any additional scripts you wish to include.

14. Continue reading to learn how to activate and use your new script(s).

## Using a Script

Once added, your script will appear in the "Added Scripts" section, located above the "Script Explorer". To activate the script, click the "Run" button. Some scripts may be single-use, meaning they execute once and do not run in the background, those scripts won't ever be shown in the "Active Scripts" section since they are not active in the background.

### Internal Usage

Be aware that the functions and applications of each script can vary. Always read any documentation or specifications provided at the script's source. If you are using our [Script Browser](script-browser.md), each script will include a brief description and usage guide, mitigating any concerns unless you use a third-party script.

## Script Browser

Once the [Script Browser](script-browser.md) releases, we will additionally document how to explore, search and add whatever scripts you want.
