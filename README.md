# 1hAck Lua Engine for OG Fortnite

## Version 1.7 Update

With the release of version 1.7, [1hAck OG Fortnite](https://1hack.org/shop) introduces a Lua scripting engine, marking it as the first-ever cheat tool with scripting support for Fortnite. We have invested over 150 hours of development time into this engine to provide a robust and user-friendly experience. This repository serves as an in-depth guide to help you leverage the full capabilities of this new groundbreaking feature.

## Why Scripting?

We are excited to open up a world of possibilities by enabling our users to create their own scripts. If you lack the time or expertise, worry not! We are in the process of developing an "Script Browser" integrated directly into the tool. This feature will allow users to easily import and deploy a wide variety of scripts, unlocking new functionalities effortlessly. Further details on the script explorer will be available in the resources below.

## Introduction to Lua and Its Relevance

If you're wondering what a "Lua Engine" is and why it matters to you as a 1hAck user, you're in the right place. Many might not be familiar with Lua, so let's begin by addressing that.

Lua is a versatile scripting language primarily designed to be embedded into applications - just like it is in 1hAck OG Fortnite. Commonly used in game engines and similar software, Lua allows users to script their own behaviors and features. In the context of 1hAck OG Fortnite, this means enabling our community to develop their own cheat features easily, with minimal prior knowledge of game hacking required.

### Summary

To summarize, the newly introduced "Lua Engine" enables users to develop their own features for the tool. Furthermore, we will soon launch an "Script Browser," which will allow users to publish and share their scripts. This feature is slated for release in the coming days or weeks.

## Getting Started

To begin, navigate to the "Scripts" tab in the 1hAck OG Fortnite GUI menu. Within this tab, you'll find three main sections:

- **Active Scripts**: This section displays all currently running scripts.

- **Added Scripts**: This section lists all scripts that you've added but are not currently running.

- **Script Explorer**: This is a built-in file explorer for adding individual script files to the menu.

### Creating Scripts

If you plan to create your own scripts, you'll need to create a new `.lua` file for each. We recommend organizing different features into separate script files for better readability and maintainability, especially as your scripts grow in complexity. Start by reading the [API introduction](docs/api-introduction.md).

### Using Existing Scripts

If you prefer to use existing scripts, that's perfectly fine. Please refer to the "How to Add Existing Scripts" section below for instructions. Although there are currently no public scripts available, this will change with the upcoming release of the "Script Browser".

**WARNING:** It's crucial to be careful when using third-party scripts. Lua is a powerful programming language, and it is entirely possible for malicious scripts to be created. Even though these scripts run within our isolated Engine, they can still access files and the internet. Always be sure to verify the source and integrity of any "unofficial" or "unverified" script before using it. However, rest assured that all scripts submitted to our "Script Browser" will undergo a thorough **verification process** by our development team before being made publicly available. This makes the "Script Browser" a reliable and secure source for obtaining scripts and add-ons once it is launched.
