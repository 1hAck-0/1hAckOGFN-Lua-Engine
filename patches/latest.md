# Patch Notes

This section will keep you updated on all the changes and updates made to the Lua Engine. Right now, as this is the first release, there aren't any patches to report.

Please note that these patch notes focus solely on updates to the built-in [Lua API](../docs/api.md). If you're not creating your own scripts, these updates may not be directly relevant to you.
